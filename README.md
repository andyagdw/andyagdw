    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hey there!👋 I'm Andy, a student currently diving deep into the world of software engineering through a Skills Bootcamp at CoGrammar and HyperionDev💥. My coding journey began during my university days when I embarked on a 'Year in Computing' as part of my Criminology and Sociology degree around 2022/23. Since then, I have become passionate about all things coding and programming and I'm excited to see where this journey takes me in the world of technology and innovation😁.</p>
