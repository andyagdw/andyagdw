# About Me
Hey there, I'm Andy👋. My coding journey began during my university days when I embarked on a 'Year in Computing' as part of my Criminology
and Sociology degree around 2022/23. Since then, I have become passionate about all things coding and programming, and I'm excited to see where
this journey takes me in the world of technology and innovation😁. 

I am currently nearing the end of my software engineering Skills Bootcamp at CoGrammar and HyperionDev💥.

## Skills
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 💻
- Python 🐍
- Git ⌨️
- React ⚛️

## Projects I am currently working on
- **Sticky Notes Task Manager Application**: A task management app allowing users to perform
CRUD operations on tasks.
  * Built with Django
- **Word Wizards learning platform**: 'Word Wizards' is a learning platform that helps users expand their vocabulary and enhance language skills.
Tailored for different user levels (Starter to Pro), it uses the WordsAPI to provide detailed word information. Users can log in, favourite words,
view word details, and upgrade their accounts for more features.
